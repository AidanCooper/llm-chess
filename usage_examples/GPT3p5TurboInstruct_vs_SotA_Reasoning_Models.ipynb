    "## gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct vs State of the Art Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook plays chess games between GPT 3.5 Turbo Instruct (released in 2023) and three state of the art reasoning models released in 2025 (Grok 4, OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro). Two games are played per reasoning model opponent — one with GPT 3.5 as white; one as black.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured outputs were not enforced — the reasoning models were instructed to only return the selected move as the final response. An illegal move or malformatted response is considered an instant loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT 3.5 Turbo Instruct wins all six games:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "1. GPT 3.5 vs Grok 4         : GPT 3.5 wins by checkmate\n",
    "2. Grok 4 vs GPT 3.5         : Grok 4 loses by illegal move 'Re4' (GPT 3.5 has a 1240 centipawn advantage)\n",
    "3. GPT 3.5 vs OpenAI o3      : OpenAI o3 loses by illegal move 'Qh7' (GPT 3.5 has mate in one)\n",
    "4. OpenAI o3 vs GPT 3.5      : GPT 3.5 wins by checkmate\n",
    "5. GPT 3.5 vs Gemini 2.5 Pro : GPT 3.5 wins by checkmate\n",
    "6. Gemini 2.5 Pro vs GPT 3.5 : GPT 3.5 wins by checkmate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other observations:\n",
    "- Runtimes:\n",
    "  - Grok 4 is extremely slow, with game durations of 4h40m and 5h28m. I'm not sure if this is a rate limiting issue, slow token generation, excessive yapping, or something else.\n",
    "  - OpenAI o3's game durations were 1h39m and 2h44m.\n",
    "  - Gemini 2.5 Pro is extremely fast, with game durations of 28s and 26s. This implies it elected to do little-to-no reasoning, which could be a misinterpretation of the promp instructions: \"RESPOND DIRECTLY WITH ONLY THE MOVE, no other text.\""
